# From v0.X to v1.X

This is a brief guide on migrating from Pode.Web v0.X to v1.X.

In Pode.Web v1.X all elements are now rendered client-side using JavaScript, rather than server-side using `.pode` view files. There are still some base view files for HTML boilerplate, but everything else has been migrated. This will help take some load away from the server, and allow element rendering to be more dynamic and "on-the-fly". (ie: a table can now contain any element, not just 5 randomly pre-selected elements).

## Actions

### Outputs

In Pode.Web v1.X to render a new element(s) on your page you can just call the relevant `New-PodeWebX` function. This now means the following `Out-PodeWebX` functions are redundant:

  * `Out-PodeWebTable`
  * `Out-PodeWebChart`
  * `Out-PodeWebTextbox`
  * `Out-PodeWebBreadcrumb`

The `New-PodeWebX` functions for each have been updated so you can more easily switch from one to the other - the only new requirement is that a `-Name` or `-Id` is required, and you'll also need to pipe the function into a new `Out-PodeElement` function. This new latter function is so that Pode.Web can more appropriately append the element to the page - you can also tweak the appending rule to append the element before the "sender".

For example to output an adhoc Table to show some processes via a Form would be:

```powershell
$form = New-PodeWebForm -Name 'Search Processes' -AsCard -ScriptBlock {
    Get-Process -Name $WebEvent.Data.Name -ErrorAction Ignore |
        Select-Object Name, ID, WorkingSet, CPU |
        New-PodeWebTable -Name 'Output' |
        Out-PodeWebElement
} -Content @(
    New-PodeWebTextbox -Name 'Name'
)
```

Or the same for a Chart:

```powershell
$form = New-PodeWebForm -Name 'Top X Processes' -AsCard -ScriptBlock {
    Get-Process |
        Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending |
        Select-Object -First $WebEvent.Data.Amount |
        ConvertTo-PodeWebChartData -LabelProperty ProcessName -DatasetProperty CPU |
        New-PodeWebChart -Name 'Output' -Type Line |
        Out-PodeWebElement
} -Content @(
    New-PodeWebTextbox -Name 'Amount'
)
```

Or for a Textbox:

```powershell
$form = New-PodeWebForm -Name 'Search Processes' -AsCard -ScriptBlock {
    $processes = Get-Process -Name $WebEvent.Data.Name -ErrorAction Ignore |
        Select-Object Name, ID, WorkingSet, CPU

    $processes |
        New-PodeWebTextbox -Name 'Output' -Multiline -Preformat -AsJson -Size ((6 * $processes.Length) + 2) |
        Out-PodeWebElement
} -Content @(
    New-PodeWebTextbox -Name 'Name'
)
```

### Validation

Any references to `Out-PodeWebValidation` should be updated to `Show-PodeWebValidation` - no other changes are needed, just a function rename.

### Tabs

Any references to `Move-PodeWebTab` should be updated to `Move-PodeWebTabs`. This will still do the same logic of moving a Tabs element to the next Tab, but there's now a new `-Direction` parameter to also cycle to the previous Tab.

## NoForm and NoLabels

In Pode.Web v1.X the new element rendering is more aware if an input element is being rendered within in a Form, or not. Because of this the `-NoForm` and `-NoLabels` parameters are now all redundant, and have been removed from the following functions:

* `New-PodeWebTextbox`
* `New-PodeWebFileUpload`
* `New-PodeWebCheckbox`
* `New-PodeWebRadio`
* `New-PodeWebSelect`
* `New-PodeWebRange`
* `New-PodeWebCredential`
* `New-PodeWebDateTime`
* `New-PodeWebMinMax`

## Elements and Layouts

All elements that can contain other elements, like a Paragraph; Form; or Tab for example, can now contain any type - since Layouts/Elements are now all one. The only exception is elements that have a specific parent/child relation, such as Accordions and Bellows.

Because of this change, functions that had `-Layouts` or `-Elements` parameters have be renamed to `-Content`:

* `New-PodeWebParagraph`
* `New-PodeWebTab`
* `Set-PodeWebHomePage`
* `Add-PodeWebPage`

## Component to Element

Originally there was a differentiation between Layouts and Elements in Pode.Web, but this is now being dropped and everything is just an "Element". Because of this the "Component" catch-all name is also being dropped, which means the following action functions are being renamed:

| From | To |
| ---- | -- |
| `Hide-PodeWebComponent` | `Hide-PodeWebElement` |
| `Show-PodeWebComponent` | `Show-PodeWebElement` |
| `Add-PodeWebComponentClass` | `Add-PodeWebElementClass` |
| `Remove-PodeWebComponentClass` | `Remove-PodeWebElementClass` |
| `Set-PodeWebComponentStyle` | `Set-PodeWebElementStyle` |
| `Remove-PodeWebComponentStyle` | `Remove-PodeWebElementStyle` |

The parameters of these functions remains unchanged.

### Events

The `-Component` parameter on `Register-PodeWebEvent` and `Register-PodeWebMediaEvent` has also been renamed to `-Element`. This is usually passed via piped input so shouldn't affect anyone too much.

## ReadOnly and Disabled

In some places the ReadOnly/Disabled parameters were being used as if they were the same thing - these have been split out into two different parameters. Because of this split, the `-ReadOnly` parameter on `New-PodeWebSelect` is now `-Disabled`, and its counterpart of `Update-PodeWebSelect` has had its `-ReadOnlyState` parameter renamed to `-DisabledState`.
