# From v0.5 to v0.6

This is a brief guide on the breaking changes introduced into v0.6 from v0.5.

## Select

The `-NoChooseOption` and `-ChooseOptionValue` parameters on `New-PodeWebSelect` have been removed. The default "choose an option" option has also been removed.

If you want to have a first option of "choose an option", this can be defined as the first option in the `-Options` array:

```powershell
New-PodeWebSelect -Name 'Role' -Options @('Choose...', 'User', 'Admin', 'Operations')
```
