# From v0.4 to v0.5

This is a brief guide on the breaking changes introduced into v0.5 from v0.4.

## Icons

The icon pack pre-v0.5 was Feather Icons, however in v0.5 this has been changed to [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/). This does mean that most of the icon names you're passing to the `-Icon` parameters now won't work; to find the names for new icons you can [search here](https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/5.4.55/) - the name should be the icon name without the starting `mdi-`.

For example let's say you need the `mdi-github` icon, then you only need to supply the `github` part of the name:

```powershell
New-PodeWebButton -Name 'Repository' -Icon 'github' -Url 'https://github.com/Badgerati/Pode.Web'
```

## Tables

On `New-PodeWebTable` the `-Filter` and `-Sort` switches now default to server-side filtering/sorting; where the filter/sort details can be accessed via the following `$WebEvent` properties in a table's `-ScriptBlock`:

* `$WebEvent.Data.Filter`
* `$WebEvent.Data.SortColumn`
* `$WebEvent.Data.SortDirection`

For more information, see the [table](../../../Tutorials/Elements/Table) documentation.

To use the original filter/sort JavaScript logic you can use the new `-SimpleFilter` and `-SimpleSort` switches.

## Page URLs

Pages that you create and assign into groups now have the group name in the URL path.

For example, the following would be a page at `/pages/Example`:

```powershell
Add-PodeWebPage -Name Example
```

Where as the following would be two pages at `/groups/Group1/pages/Example` and `/groups/Group2/pages/Example`:

```powershell
Add-PodeWebPage -Name Example -Group1
Add-PodeWebPage -Name Example -Group2
```

## Lists

The `-Items` parameter on `New-PodeWebList` now takes an array of `New-PodeWebListItem`s instead. The new `-Values` parameter takes the original string array.
